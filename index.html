        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space.While the study of space is
            carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration though is conducted both by unmanned
            robotic space probes and human spaceflight. While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates
            reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth
            century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include
            advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of
            humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. Space exploration has often
            been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the Cold War. The early era of space exploration
            was driven by a "Space Race" between the Soviet Union and the United States. The launch of the first human-made
            object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American
            Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program
            achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight
            (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic
            landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971. After
            the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space
            Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS). With the
            substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remain
            in flux. Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020 was judged inadequately
            funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009. The Obama Administration proposed a revision
            of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit
            (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles
            for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO,
            such as Earth–Moon L1, the Moon, Earth–Sun L2, near-Earth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit. In the 2000s,
            the People's Republic of China initiated a successful manned spaceflight program, while the European Union, Japan,
            and India have also planned future crewed space missions. China, Russia, Japan, and India have advocated crewed
            missions to the Moon during the 21st century, while the European Union has advocated manned missions to both
            the Moon and Mars during the 20th and 21st century From the 1990s onwards, private interests began promoting
            space tourism and then public space exploration of the Moon (see Google Lunar X Prize).

        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>Mankind has always been fascinated with exploring the unknown. From sailing to distant lands to someday setting foot
            on other planets, the spirit of exploration is the same. Bur now with the current economic situation and the
            high cost of sending people to space, NASA is being looked at as a way to free up some much needed funds. Although,
            there is many problems here on planet Earth that need addressing, the benefits of space exploration far out weight
            the disadvantages. Space exploration has given us more advanced technology, advances in the medical field, and
            a boost to the economy and these facts cannot be disputed. Since we first sent rockets into Earths orbit, we
            have been pushing the technological boundaries in order to reach new…show more content… There is also a huge
            risk of the spread of sickness because astronauts live in such close quarters. “During space travel, exposure
            to microgravity, radiation, and stress alter human immunoregulatory responses, which can in turn impact an astronaut’s
            ability to prevent acquisition of infectious agents or reactivation of latent infection. In addition, microgravity
            affects virulence, growth kinetics, and biofilm formation of potential microbial pathogens.” (Mermel, 2013) This
            just shows some of the possible risks astronauts may encounter during a prolonged space flight such as one to
            the moon or another planet. Because of all these risks NASA has created an extensive screening process and materials
            to help counter the spread of disease and infection in a space craft. These advances not only help astronauts
            but they also have applications for us on earth. We have already seen many of these “spin off” technologies like
            the implantable pacemaker, Lasik eye surgery and the MRI and CAT scan. Space exploration has and will continue
            to provide a large boost to the economy. “Missions such as the launch and operation of communications and remote
            sensing satellites, scientific satellites and, of course, military surveillance satellites, have been the stock-in-trade
            of the commercial sector for decades, and represent an industry worth S300-billion annually.” (Watson, 2013)
            Not only is there a lot of money in the business of sending an space craft but also it is a pride for the nation.

        <h2>First human outer space flight</h2>
        <p>
            The first successful human spaceflight was Vostok 1 ("East 1"), carrying 27-year-old Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on 12
            April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's
            flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened
            an entirely new era in space exploration

            <center>Lionel Messi</center>
        </h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini born 24 June 1987 is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains
            both Spanish club Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and
            widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or awards and
            a record six European Golden Shoes. He has spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he has
            won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, four UEFA Champions League titles and six Copas
            del Rey. A prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (437),
            a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8),
            and most assists in La Liga (181) and the Copa América (12). He has scored over 700 senior career goals for club
            and country. Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for
            whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for
            the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve
            the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons
            followed, with Messi winning three consecutive Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. During the 2011–12
            season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing
            himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or
            behind Cristiano Ronaldo—his perceived career rival—before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign,
            becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he
            was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed the captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he secured
            a record sixth Ballon d'Or.

        <h2>Club career: </h2>
        <h2>Barcelona</h2>
        <p>2003–05: Rise to the first team "It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life." —Barcelona's then assistant
            coach Henk Ten Cate on Messi's first-team debut. During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi
            rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five teams in a single campaign. After being
            named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played
            only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11
            league games. Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during
            the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training
            session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: "He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to
            avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and
            score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien." At 16 years, four months,
            and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against
            José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003. His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed
            the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well
            as weekly with the first team. After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player,
            Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.
            Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called "little brother", which greatly eased his transition into the
            first team. To gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juveniles A, playing
            his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera
            División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match
            while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos. His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed
            on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30 million. A month later,
            on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically
            increased to €80 million.He played five games with the B team that season but did not score. Physically he was
            weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his
            muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he
            returned to both youth teams, helping the Juveniles B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored
            for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.
        </p>
        <h2>Messi playing against Málaga in October 2005
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring
            on six occasions. Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but
            in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him. Since Ronaldinho already played
            on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against
            the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.
            Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute.
            At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in
            an official competition. As a substitute player, he played 77 minutes in nine matches for the first team that
            season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk. He scored his first senior
            goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever
            scorer for the club. Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six
            years.
        </p>
        <h2>2012: A record-breaking year</h2>
        <p>"I feel sorry for those who want to compete for Messi's throne – it's impossible, this kid is unique." —Pep Guardiola
            after Messi became Barcelona's all-time top scorer at age 24 in March 2012.As Messi maintained his goalscoring
            form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March,
            two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions
            League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.In
            addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals,
            tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller
            to be top scorer in four campaigns.Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's
            history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against
            Granada. Messi pointing to the sky following his record five-goal display against Bayer Leverkusen in the last
            16 of the UEFA Champions League in March 2012 Despite Messi's individual form, Barcelona's four-year cycle of
            success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club's history – drew to an end.Although Barcelona
            won the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao on 25 May, its 14th title of that period, the team lost the league
            to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Chelsea, with
            Messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar. In Barça's last home league match on 5
            May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had
            announced his resignation as manager. He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second
            time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Müller's 67 goals
            in the 1972–73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football.
            Under manager Tito Vilanova, who had first coached him aged 14 at La Masia, Messi helped the club achieve its
            best-ever start to a La Liga season during the second half of 2012, amassing 55 points by the competition's midway
            point, a record in Spanish football. A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi break two longstanding
            records: he surpassed César Rodríguez's record of 190 league goals, becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer
            in La Liga, and Gerd Müller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year, overtaking his 85 goals scored
            in 1972 for Bayern Munich and Germany. Messi sent Müller a number 10 Barcelona shirt, signed "with respect and
            admiration", after breaking his 40-year record. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals
            in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. Although FIFA did not acknowledge the achievement, citing verifiability
            issues, he received the Guinness World Records title for most goals scored in a calendar year.As the odds-on
            favourite, Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four
            times.
